    Vet recursive bounds code against empty area
    * Code headers and copyright? Licenses?

Patterns:
    Ideally, we wouldn't just be able to specify an image that is repeated, but a Scene should work.
        SVG supports arbitrary SVG content under a pattern
        Canvas supports its union type (CanvasImageSource) which includes <img> or <canvas>

Canvas:
    Consider adding layer strategies that enforce either a low-def or hi-def (if available) canvas backing store, so we can have crispness when desired
        Different LayerTypes, flesh out supports()?
    Check reindexing, there may be bugs
    Restricted bounds intersection pruning (also see performance)
        For canvas rendering, how to handle restricted bounds in depthFirstUntil? Generalize, and allow a return flag to indicate not hitting children?
    Clip shapes that are nested are probably broken
    CanvasLayer styles are probably broken - resetStyles seems fishy if not in sync (i.e. lineCap)

DOM:
    * DOM bounds failure on construction, for x and y setters (or something is wrong with easel-tests DOM example, investigate?)
    *** CSS3 transforms look amazing See if we can do more in DOM nodes with transforms
        Example: http://www.clicktorelease.com/code/css3dclouds/
    Handle correct layering of DOM nodes inside a layer, etc.
    [IMPLEMENTATION REMOVED] Hoisting of interactive DOM nodes
        - HoistedDOMLayer that adds (2147483647/2) to its z-index
            Pro:
                layering will work in the browser
            Con:
                splits more layers than necessary
                have to add a listener in the capture phase of the listener to flag the event as hitting the interactive node?
                need to check for 'interactive' flag?
                Events system may need to discard anything in the region of an interactive node's bounds?
        - Either delegate (just set transform) or have inline with just SVG over (with pointer-events)

** SVG: -- important because we can layer DOM nodes properly under SVG
    Domparser and xmlserializer are ie9 for avg fragment support
    Allow different options for splitting the root transform between CSS / SVG
    * Apply pointer-events: none
    *** Highly recommend <image xlink:href="...">, since we can include URL / data URL, nesting works, and we don't pollute the id namespace
        Direct nesting fails in IE9
    * Need to be able to pull bounds out of SVG fragments.
        Should be specified in the SVG element.
    SVGLayer needs have CSS transform with a scale of 1, apply scale to containing group instead?
    Examine Raphael JS for SVG support and Code.
    Possible SVG Safari issues if bounds aren't whole-pixel?
    Investigate SVG crispEdges to see whether it would be valuable for other renderers

** WebGL:
    Use display lists?
    Examine test code for considerations for implementing Shape.

Layers / caching:
    Consider option that would resize / position canvas/svg elements to smaller portions of the screen for lower memory usage (and possibly better performance?)
        Tiling, possibly lock to every 16 pixels. Prevent back-and-forth every frame, and consider full size for animation vs changing
        Would be setting position (layout change) and possibly width. If we can keep width the same, it may be faster?
        * Also do this for CSS transforms on SVG. Resizing is causing slowness
    * Move Trail / TrailPointer to util?
    Implications of last boundary's previousEndPointer being null? (vs scene.after)
    * Make RendererOptions its own class with utilities, that can be added?
    Refreshing / changes:
        Think conceptually between 'self' nodes. Just refresh between the minimum bounding self nodes that were not affected by the change.
            1) Walk up to the first unaffected self, copy layer type from active layer
            2) Walk through to last unaffected self
            3) Stitch together based on that information
        SVG: ref-count groups by children, so that we can remove unused groups
    Performance hints
        Dynamic, so we could set node.movement = 'dynamic' while moving, node.movement = 'static' while stationary?
        Generalized performance flags, so that each node can vary is renderer / settings based on desired appearance
            quality: 'low' / 'medium' / 'high' ?
            flags like 'moving' or 'stationary' could help for dynamic objects. Scenery would then decide whether to optimize the layers or not
    Transform "caching" should be shared between the CSS / Canvas(local)-based methods
        Deal with making sure we don't have "clipping" of the bounds
    ** Slight bit of rounding if necessary to pixel-aligned integral numbers may get performance benefits
        Option to disallow subpixel handling?
    Canvas / WebGL:
        drawImage is used instead of CSS transforms, but same general model, and we should take the same flags.
        Have a scratch canvas stack for things like opacity
            Function to determine whether a node needs to write to a global scratch canvas or just the top of the stack (i.e. opacity < 1 || flag)
            Have a pool of canvases around for this specifically?
        "Global":
            Could combine with the Layer's canvas stack?
            A full scratch canvas wouldn't be able to take care of translations, but would be extremely fast for re-rendering things that didn't change at all.
        "Local":
            Possible to have a single scratch canvas for a Node, even in DAG situations, since RenderState only tracks clipping / opacity (handled already)
    ** WebGL: Caching SVG / Canvas as a texture would allow extremely fast dragging?
        How to allow children to render as a different renderer (canvas?) to then transfer into a texture?
    Proof-of-concept for performance and DOM integration

* Event dispatch:
    Add Pen support
    * Hook into browser 'zoom' support? - pinch-to-zoom is different? Maybe we can detect?
    Investigate Event.preventManipulation
    ** MSPointerMove filter since location may not have changed while touch is down!!!
        See http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/10/19/handling-multi-touch-and-mouse-input-in-all-browsers.aspx
    ** Handle the actual 'out/over' events properly
    **** Restrict SimpleDragHandler to bounds?
    **** Write a multi-finger pinch-to-zoom/rotate handler that is compatible with the drag handler
        Use SVD finger point code for 3+ fingers -- also this could cause shears, so flag for whether 3+ fingers allowed and for shear
        Option whether to rotate/translate/scale or not (for each)
        Option for bounds restriction on dragged center point
        Option whether to interrupt dragging
        Consider 'active' flag
        Need the ability to get a list of all fingers
        How to deal with mouse-wheel events? Scroll if zoomed in?
    Consider all elements under point: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh673523.aspx
    * SimpleDragHandler needs an option for increased hit areas for touch
    Consider finger.isDown for checking general (but possibly mouse related) events
    Indie UI events should be tracked: https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/IndieUI/raw-file/default/src/indie-ui-events.html
    Verify SVG stacking is practical with test
        -- do we need pointer-events on every element, or just the top-level svg?
    Picking - see TODO under Node
    Enter/Exit events on up/down? - see question above
    Freeze event handlers, a la the DOM 3 Events spec? Or copy Piccolo?
    Best pattern for handling drags / more persistence? Add listeners directly to finger?
        Standard flags on fingers for whether they are performing an operation? dragging, etc.
        A way to 'cancel' the operation a finger is currently doing, so it can switch to a different one?
    Mouse enter/exit needs to trigger for node add/remove
        Does it make sense to hit-test every frame for this?
    How to hit test against DOM nodes?
    Use cases:
        Zoom / Pinch / Drag with interrupts
        Increased hit areas for touch
        Showing where the fingers are with a display (for projectors)

Accessibility / shadow DOM:
    ARIA in general?

        spec: http://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/

Node:
    Feature TODO:
        Sub-tree opacity (like setTransparency in Piccolo)
            'transparency', 'opacity', or 'alpha'?
            Canvas: globalAlpha?
                * This would require rendering into off-screen canvases in order to composite this as expected
            SVG: how to handle?
                group opacity ('opacity' attribute)
        Pickable flag - check Piccolo behavior. consider flag for whether invisible nodes get picked or not (probably yes, for hit regions!)
    Consider assert to warn on nonexistent mutator key.
    Ability to specify children in arg, i.e. setChildren, that will fail if there are any at all, so we can do Node( { children: ... } );
    Support setting some settings in the mutator with other objects. e.g.:
        new Node( { scale: { x: 1, y: 2 } } );
    Support for setting listeners in the mutator?
    Since cursor might support data URLs, we can have custom cursors?
    Batching of insertions / removals, so that we could consider completely changing children, removing all children, etc. at the same time
        Possibly consider batching these together until updateScene?
        Then: add children mutator (setChildren, getChildren) so that it is convenient to set up trees of nodes?
            Would require renaming node.children to node._children, and consider whether getChildren should have the slice precaution
    A system for cursor handling that also supports dragging or 'persistent' cursor handling
    Bounds after rotation seems to be a bit too wide
    * Fire event on change of layerStrategy, and possibly rethink layerStrategy design
    Mix-in notifier for listeners
    ** Canvas fill gradients / patterns / dashes
        Can this be abstracted across SVG / WebGL layers also? -- probably WebGL _much_ more efficiently with shaders
    For prepend-flags, set in parameter object instead of boolean flag? (somewhat hard-to-read code)
    Visibility interaction with dirty paint / bounds, and events based on that
        Scene.updateLayer shouldn't be called if only invisible nodes were changed?
    Don't send mark updates on invisible layers? Visibility change causes repaint?
    General optimization and organization so we can extract "self" from child rendering bounds, what is repainted, etc. better.
    Function for higher-performance possibly-expanded bounds for redraw?
        Should we have an option so that selfBounds uses this?
    For bounds checking during rendering, isInGlobalBounds( globalBounds, currentTransform ) would help, and shapes could be more specific
    Canvas: masking with sub-canvas rendering using globalCompositeOperation. CSG should be possible, and hit tests should be better. Bounds might be harder

Text:
    Unit tests
    *** Performance of text bounds!
        Comparison vs accurate bounds for all of the various text bounds methods
    Investigate SVG's writing-mode for rtl/ltr handling (also direction and unicode-bidi)
    Handling multi-line strings
    WebGL / DOM options
    Allow stroking of text.

Scene:
    Acceleration of layer lookup
    Spread out z-indices and be adaptive so we don't have to change as many indices where possible
    refreshLayers() implementation (currently rebuilds all layers, but should be optimized so it doesn't need to redraw as much)
    Foundation for multiple view implementations
    spread out z-indices and be adaptive so we don't have to change as many indices where possible

Trail:
    ** Fast Trail lookup data structure (used in scenes to find where a trail is in terms of pointers, and also for Node-to-trail handling)
    ** Verify current indexing handling (is it sufficient to just reindex trails on layer refreshes?)
    Use indices where possible (next and previous!)
    DO we need indices in Node.dispatchEvent? May be bottleneck
    Cleanup of nestedForwards/nestedBackwards, possibly based on a Side-like implementation. Decent code duplication!
    Better name for copy()? clone()? getCopy()? Possibly use a copy constructor?
    depthFirstUntil should possibly have option for defensive copies of the pointers?

Build:
    Add JSHint into Sublime Text with plugin?

Path:
    * convenience functions on scenery namespace for common shapes
    ** consider new scenery.Path( shape, args )
        Maybe even new scenery.Rectangle( width, height, { ... } )? Ability to set width / height, and similar other attributes for RegularPolygon, etc?

Performance:
    *** Garbage collection jitters!
    *** Performance regressions with layering
    * Prune node rendering based on visible dirty bounds
    Consider checking for hotspots and layer changes based on that
        Ref-count number of descendants? Should be fast for insert/remove child
    Not re-rasterizing objects immediately during dragging or other features? (Auto-detect as hotspot maybe?)
    Ensure that we are triggering the hardware acceleration for CSS3 transforms
    Consider model changes in setInterval: http://www.chandlerprall.com/2012/06/requestanimationframe-is-not-your-logics-friend/
    * IE9 performance (possible regression?)
        Get DebugContext to work with Easel for a comparison? Or just compare against vanilla Canvas code
        "strict mode" removal wasn't effective
        Possible that it's the clipping that we are doing?
    Framebuffer with context.drawImage( bufferContext, 0, 0 );
    Consider child counts, so that we can decide which layers to keep in a layer rebuild?
    Piece improvements with direct piece.render calls instead of switch? -- profile
    Improved Dirty regions
        * not full union of bounding boxes
        * Kd-tree / quadtree acceleration if child count is high? 
    Caching nodes with off-screen canvases for performance
        Global-bounds based. Store global transform, so we can (each frame) compare the current transform and see if it is just an
        approximately integer-offset transformation. Then we can render quickly on integer boundaries with no transforms / scaling for speed.
        Consider CSS3 transforms for possibly increased performance compared to drawImage( x, 0, 0 ), as we can do this with anything
        Add RenderState flag that allows using cached handling, or forces a full redraw
    Improve quadratic bezier offset curve computation
    Combining fills and strokes (or other state optimization -- fills require ensuring CCW/CW stays the same, so we need flags to whitelist)
        ! shape strokes happen with linewidth scaled by current transform -- if transforms change scale (or possibly shear), this will break
    Efficiency checks for fullRender using the functional style => imperative
    Automated benchmarks
    Investigate whether bounding boxes can be smaller based on clip shapes
    Non-automated performance tests:
        Compare Matrix3 Float32Array v. Array (Array seems slightly faster possibly?)
        Consider a Canvas 2D context delegate to examine drawing calls for Easel / Scene / Custom / etc.
    Checklists:
        http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/performance/

Benchmarks:
    (deprecate?) Benchmark.js-based:
        async vs defer vs queued
        Ability to re-run tests to add precision? Or just a control for precision?
            Add a flag for the tests being run (or null for all tests)
            Store results[][] instead of benchmarks[][], and add benchmarks to the result (combining statistics, etc).
            Add ability to scrap statistics
            Have an updateResult function that will handle the updating
            Benchmark cycling feedback?
        If we can, handle both synchronous and asynchronous tests. Maybe this is possible to wrap with a deferred so that we can handle both without specifying a flag?
            Consider forking Benchmark.js and submitting a pull request if this is easy
            Reason for this is the issue where in asynchronous tests, immediate calls to deferred.resolve() do not allow us to measure performance if it is slow
                See http://jsperf.com/asynchronous-limit
            Ask John David Dalton maybe?
            Synchronous: for checking Scenery overhead
            Asynchronous - requestAnimationFrame loops
                We need to verify that these tests are fully taxing the system (maybe 20% less FPS than an empty loop in requestAnimationFrame?)
    Performance based:
        * submodules of self?
        Add exception handling
        Consider using Local Storage to show previous results?
        Examine subclass penalty for Shape in Path instead of Node
    Using xStats (https://github.com/bestiejs/xstats.js), also add memory output for verifying lack of memory leaks?

Property / Notifiers:
    Add the listeners, etc. straight to the object?
        Investigate:
            WatchJS - https://github.com/melanke/Watch.JS
            Backbone - a la sidebar.set( { color: 'white' } ); -- but not property specific
                or Embed or Angular?
            Bacon.js?
    Possibly use jQuery events?

Color:
    Should use JS style color definitions instead

Features:
    AnimateTo-style animation
    Clipping => Dead region handling (clipping needs to be stored in a shape array since it can only be intersected or reset in Canvas)
    Color handling?
    Investigate DAG version?
    Include MathJax text?
    Property change events for nodes?

Cleanliness / Debugging:
    *** Debug layer
        Or just debug out a tree view (using scenery of course).
            Previews inside nodes if hasSelf()
            Show layers and bounds
            Mouse-over shows bounds (possibly recursive), etc.
    Ability to create a debugging dump of scene graph
    Code style should match https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js

// implicit layering switches due to node types

// force SVG layer(s) under node where possible
node.layerStrategy.setPreferredLayerType( scenery.LayerType.SVG );

// force a layer split before / after
node.layerStrategy.setSplitBefore( true );
node.layerStrategy.setSplitAfter( true );

node.layerStrategy = new SomethingLayerStrategy();

// performance caching (new node, so we can do render path changes?)
var cacheNode = new CanvasLayerCache( node ) {{
  var domNode = <svg, dom, canvas, ...>

  // internal to CanvasLayerCache:
  cacheNode.layerStrategy = new CanvasCachingStrategy( domNode, ... ) {{
    // internal to CanvasCachingStrategy
    preferredLayerType = CacheLayer( ... domElement ... )?
    
    .. handle CSS3 transforms here
  }};
}} // paints into canvas(es), with custom layer type



var node = scenery.SVG( '<svg>....</svg>' | $( SVGEelement ) );
node.x = (etc.)

scene resize listeners?


Layering API
============

renderer: 'svg' / 'canvas' / 'webgl' / 'dom'
movement: 'dynamic' / 'static' ? 'translation', 'affine', ...?
* might help to save an internal flag that signals whether this node "modifies layers", as above.
* or specify as render: { renderer: 'svg', ... }, and track rendering settings separately (_render)?
Generalized performance flags, so that each node can vary is renderer / settings based on desired appearance
    quality: 'low' / 'medium' / 'high' ?
    flags like 'moving' or 'stationary' could help for dynamic objects. Scenery would then decide whether to optimize the layers or not

SR: possibly have separate files for DOMImage, SVGImage, etc.
    Advantages:
        SVGImage.doRandomSVGThingToImage (that only works for SVG)
            Or maybe we just have settings for a particular type?
        Decoupled
        Clear what combinations are supported
    Problem:
        At lot of shared code?
            Factor out
