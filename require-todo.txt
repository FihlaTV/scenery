** Debug assertions, and performance handling
  Decide on best way to include assert control

Better packaging?

requestAnimationFrame

Rename main.js to namespace.js? so it's easy to pull require( 'SCENERY/namespace' ) for full API access

'mangle' off for the standalone/development versions

require() is failing silently if the dependency is circular. consider throwing an error in that case?
require() || throw Error( 'bad dependency!' ); -- can't inline, otherwise discovery won't work
