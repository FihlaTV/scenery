Just for the layering branch!
=============================



Default layer types, so that we can specify "svg under here if possible" - in LayerState

DAG support
  Multiple views for free
    Support possibly for multiple scene roots?
  For node actions that involve the layer reference, instead just fire off events to listeners
  DOM is an issue for DAG support - unless we can duplicate it?


Node:
  Self can be rendered to different layers
    Children for even more layers
    On an event that changes potential layering, fire an event somehow that reaches all applicable scenes
  
  Has LayerStrategy: called during layering from each relevant scene.




Design
======

LayerFactory? -- more general, possible advantages

LayerState:
  - compacts layers as necessary (don't instantiate until something hasSelf())
  preferredLayerType

Node:
  LayerStrategy (called during layering from each relevant scene)
    enter()
      afterSelf() ?
      betweenChildren() ?
    exit()


Issues
======

Hoisting of interactive DOM nodes


API Usage
=========

// force SVG layer(s) under node where possible
node.layerStrategy.setPreferredLayerType( scenery.SVGLayer );

// force a layer split before / after
node.layerStrategy.setSplitBefore( true );
node.layerStrategy.setSplitAfter( true );

// performance caching (new node, so we can do render path changes?)
var cacheNode = new CanvasLayerCache( node ) {{
  // internal to CanvasLayerCache:
  cacheNode.layerStrategy = new CanvasCachingStrategy( ... ) {{
    // internal to CanvasCachingStrategy
    preferredLayerType = CacheLayer( ... domElement ... )?
  }};
}} // paints into canvas(es), with custom layer type
