Testing HTML5 scene graph concepts
==================================

This is under active prototyping, so please expect any sort of API to change. Comments at this stage are very welcome.

Since the concatenated / minified JS is under .gitignore, please either use the
associated Makefile (with 'make') or the Windows batch script 'build.bat'.

For testing purposes, the following are currently being worked on:
* [Examples and Performance Showcase](http://phet.colorado.edu/files/phet-scene/tests/easel-performance/easel-tests.html)
* [Unit Tests](http://phet.colorado.edu/files/phet-scene/tests/unit-tests/unit-tests.html)
* [Benchmarks](http://phet.colorado.edu/files/phet-scene/tests/benchmarks/benchmarks.html)
* [WebGL Prototype](http://phet.colorado.edu/files/phet-scene/tests/webgl-test/webgl-test.html)
